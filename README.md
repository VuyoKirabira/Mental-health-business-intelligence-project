# Mental-health-business-intelligence-project
Independent business intelligence project with data analytics components focusing on university students mental health

In light of June being men's mental health month I decided to dedicate my time to develop an end to end business intelligence project with data analytics components. This is a holistic endeavor which highlights the mental health struggles university students face regardless of gender. This survey had 46 responses. Thank you to everyone who dedicated their time to allow this initiative to be possible, I hope it does help increase awareness regarding mental health and help reduce stigmas.

# My approach towards developing the BI project(ETL process):
Step 1: Conducted a survey using google forms.
Step 2: Exported the data to a CSV format.
Step 3: Data cleaning on excel using formula logic and Power query.
Step 4: Creating a fact table and the related dimension tables.
Step 4: Creating a star schema in MySQL and importing the data.
Step 5: Conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover insights I want to centre my visualizations around.
Step 6: Created visualizations in power bi.

# Key insights: 
*  In terms of the students who often feel anxious, postgraduate students feel the most anxious. This makes sense as postgrad students face issues like they have to find jobs and in south africa we have a job crisis adding to the anxiety, they face challenges transitioning from undergrad to postgrad and  limited funding options compared to undergraduate students who have NSFAS.

* Therapy has the highest effectiveness as a coping mechanism for when life gets too much followed by religion and exercise.

* Preliminary data indicates BA students have some of the lowest average mental health scores yet having some of the highest participation in the survey making their average mental scores in this survey more statistically sound compared to other degrees who had similar mental health scores but fewer participants. 
**WHY IS THIS THE CASE?** My hypothesis regarding this is BA students do modules like sociology which forces them to be more socially aware and cognisant of themselves as well as society in general. This is a double edged sword because in as much as they more cognisant of societal issues like systematic injustices and oppression and they are more curious about these issues leading down a spiraling hole where they are faced with the truth about this world we live in. Imagine you’re in the movie “matrix” once you wake up you can't see the world the same. Awareness can be both a gift and a burden.

**Data skills used:** Data cleaning,data transformation,exploratory data analysis and data visualization
**Tools and platforms:** Excel, MySQL and power BI
**Technical stack:** Excel formulas, Power query, SQL, DAX 

Mental health is a challenge people in society continue to face and as a young person in data it is my responsibility to bring awareness because data isn't just numbers there are humans behind those numbers their stories,pain and injustices they face
